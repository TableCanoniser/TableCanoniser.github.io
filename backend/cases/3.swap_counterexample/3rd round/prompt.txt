The cell contents in several columns of your above code execution result are incorrect: 1. The value of the Release Date column is also related to the 'Announced Date' in messy_data. For example, the cell value in the third row of the column should be '2015 Apr'; 2. The value of Front Camera should be smaller than the value of Rear Camera, so the value of Front Camera in the third row should be '5', while the value of Rear Camera should be '16'. 
Please modify your code.
