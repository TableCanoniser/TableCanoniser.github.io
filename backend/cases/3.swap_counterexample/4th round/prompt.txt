The execution result of your above code still has issues: 1. The value of the Height column is also related to the 'H' in messy_data. For example, the cell value in the third row of the column should be '143.4 mm'. 2. The value of the Width column is also related to the 'W' in messy_data. For example, the cell value in the third row of the column should be '70.5 mm'. 3. The value of the Depth column is also related to the 'D' in messy_data. For example, the cell value in the third row of the column should be '6.8 mm'. Please modify your code.
